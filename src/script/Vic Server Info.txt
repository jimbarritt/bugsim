So a couple of other things you should know.  After you have registered
your account you should be able to log on to one of our servers to
run your program.  A couple of intel machines running NetBSD that are
good choices are barretts.mcs.vuw.ac.nz and greta-pt.mcs.vuw.ac.nz. 
Alternatively if you want a sparc running solaris you could try
debretts.mcs.vuw.ac.nz.

You'll need to set various environment variables to get an appropriate
version of java.  On our system you can do this with the locally written
"need" command.  This should be put in your .cshrc file so it gets run
each time you log on.  There are examples in the standard .cshrc file
that we set your account up with.  (If you choose to run a different
shell than tcsh you'll be on your own as far as figuring out how to
properly configure your account in our environment).

Running "need java2" will set things up to give you java 1.4.2 on both
Solaris and NetBSD.  Running 'need java2-latest' will give you java
1.5.0 (aka 5.0) on NetBSD.  Both of the NetBSD versions of Java are
actually linux binaries running on our NetBSD systems in an emulation
mode.  As an alternative you could 'need java2-native' which will give
you a non-emulated version 1.4.2 java.  I'm not a java expert so I don't
know the trade-offs of running the native vs non-native version.  Andrew
Mellanby knows more about this stuff than me and so might be able to
give you some advice.
